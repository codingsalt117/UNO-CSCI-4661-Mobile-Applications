Author: Robin Johnson

Background: The end of the world has occured, and you manage the jobs of a Taxi guild in one of the last cities that contains societies.

Game:

Once you start the game, the player enters the Guildhall and a driver roster is randomly 
generated. In the Guildhall the player can review the games lore, review the guilds roster 
of drivers or start a job. When the player chooses to review the roster of drivers, the roster 
is where all the availible drivers and their relivent stats are viewable. Below each driver is 
a button to press to tranisition to reviewing the single driver. Also, this is the place 
where the player can retore the drivers health and stamina, or upgrade the max value of 
health or stamina. These choices do cost in game currency, the drivers money stat, which is 
noted at each option. Back in the Guildhall the last choice a player can make is start a job. When the player selects start job, the player then sees the choices between Easy Job, Medium Job, or Hard job. When a job is selected a 4 x 4 "city grid" is randomly generated, with each grid having a danger rating and enemy type. Easy jobs grab two adjacent grids that comprise the jobs route that will need to be traversed to succesfully complete and a reward of $50. Medium jobs are 3 grids in length with a reward of $100 and hard jobs are 4 grids in length with a reward of $150. Once a job bifficulty is selected, then the player needs to choose a driver. The driver list here will only allow the player to choose a driver that has health and/or stamina greater than zero. As soon as the driver is choosen, the player can see the the current grid number out of the total of the job. Also viewable is the danger level of the current grid, a text describing what enemy is being faced and how much health the driver has. At each grid of the job the player has the choice of moving to the next grid of the job or to quit and return to GuildHall. The job is failed if the health drops below zero and the player is then informed such has happened and the current health of the driver. The player is successful if the driver has health by the completion of the last grid and the driver is awarded money equal to the jobs reward. If the player health drops to zero or below the driver does not die, just need to restore health in the Roster.
